                  I can't say the past two weeks have been a walk in the park. But I will say it has been one of the most informative sessions in my life. I have been debunking myths about my capabilities.

            <h2>Little Taco Shop-1</h2>
            <p>This was my first website about a retail taco shop. It solely entailed html with a touch of CSS on the table properties. All the basic features of websites were present, i.e. links and forms. The website was decent but lacked on key specializations such as being adaptable to various screen sizes. </p>

            <h2>Little Taco Shop-2</h2>
            <p>This is an upgraded version of little Taco Shop-1. It has a dedicated css style sheet embedded in it. It also makes use of media queries that make it adaptible to various screen sizes. It is visualy more vibrant as well.</p>

            <h2>Acme Rockets</h2>
            <p>This website is about a spaceship company that sells rockets. It entails html, css and tailwind css as well. It also incorporated a little Java Script for the animation in it. I particularly found coding using tailwind css as more convenient because the styles are embedded within html. I must say that it was the most challenging project to do from the setup to the intricate details. </p>
